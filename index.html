          <h3>A bit about me.</h3>
          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Vinit Parikh, a recent college grad, a DJ (some nights), a workout-a-holic, and primarily, a software developer looking for my next opportunity. Although I recently graduated from UCLA with a BS in electrical engineering, my junior year internship at Cisco Systems opened up a massive door to the rich world that is computer science. I observed many fellow interns as well as two of my college roommates as they were able to crank out working products with only two things; a brain and a laptop. I was used to building things in dense lab settings; things that took several long iterations to get working. I learned a whole lot of cool things in college, but decided that I was much more fascinated by the idea of building impactful and fully featured products with a much simpler input as well as fewer dependencies. I aim to work on products that have the potential to improve not just human lives, but all lives around the globe. The most prominent life dream I have is to eventually travel the entire world while adding something positive to every country I visit.

            <h4>Cyber Spider</h4>
            <p>This is an algorithm-heavy project simulating the prediction of cyber-attacks. Given trillions of lines of telemetry log data, this program written in C++ successfully identifies possible future attacks within a few minutes of run-time. Click to view the code!</p>

            <h4>Pirates</h4>

            <h4>Active Record Lite</h4>
            <p>Rails ships with it's own ORM, Active Record. To ensure that I didn't take any queries for granted when building Rails applications, I followed these specs to re-build Active Record from scratch. Take a look at my code below.</p>

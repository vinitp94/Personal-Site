          <h3>A bit about me.</h3>
          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Vinit Parikh, a recent college grad, a DJ (some nights), a workout-a-holic, and primarily, a software developer looking for my next opportunity. Although I recently graduated from UCLA with a BS in electrical engineering, my junior year internship at Cisco Systems opened up a massive door to the rich world that is computer science. I observed many fellow interns as well as two of my college roommates as they were able to crank out working products with only two things; a brain and a laptop. I was used to building things in dense lab settings; things that took several long iterations to get working. I learned a whole lot of cool things in college, but decided that I was much more fascinated by the idea of building impactful and fully featured products with a much simpler input as well as fewer dependencies. I aim to work on products that have the potential to improve not just human lives, but all lives around the globe. The most prominent life dream I have is to eventually travel the entire world while adding something positive to every country I visit.

        <h3>Education and Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Rather than re-typing my resume here, I figured that this would be a great opportunity to explain how all of my past education and professional experience contributed to who I am today.
        </p>
        <h5>UCLA</h5>
        <p>
          I just graduated this past summer from UCLA with a bacherlors in electrical engineering and a technical breadth in computer science. Although I am pursuing software engineering for a career, I have no regrets whatsoever from college. I learned many valuable lessons from my major; the severe difficulty allowed me to develop the ability to solve very tough problems. I had the pleasure of working through large projects both on my own and with teams. After my internship at Cisco, which I'll talk about briefly below, I decided to take my technical breadth courses in computer sciece. In doing so, I was exposed to C++ and learned most of the major algorithms and data structures by applying them to difficult projects.
        </p>
        <h5>UCLA SMERC</h5>
        <p>
          I worked as a student research intern at the UCLA SmartGrid Energy Research Center throughout my sophomore year of college. The most valuable lesson I learned here was that the most impactful products in tech are those that span multiple fields of engineering. I was surrounded by both mechanical and electrical engineers and I soon realized how one group without the other would have taken atleast triple the time they took to produce the product, which was a smart charging box for EV cars. I look forward to, one day, working with all sorts of engineers to change the world through tech.
        </p>
        <h5>Cisco Systems</h5>
        <p>
          After my junior year at UCLA, I interned for three months as a hardware developer in Cisco's IOT department. My primary project was to create a schematic for a plug in port on a router that my team had built. The details of the internship are not as important as what it taught me. After really getting my hands dirty, I saw how long the process of building hardware could be: create a schematic, get it approved, send it to a fab, wait for a pcb, test it, fix all the bugs, and repeat. I saw software engineers around me building products in less than half the time with nothing but a laptop. Being the results-driven person I am, I wanted to see the impact of my work. This internship opened the door for me and during my last year at UCLA, I took my technical breadth courses in computer science and absorbed as much knowledge as I could before graduating.
        </p>
        <h5>App Academy</h5>
        <p>
          After graduating, I did some self-learning on my own through online resources, but after a couple months, I thought it would be best to condense my education. Enter App Academy. I applied and got into App Academy, which was my first choice of software coding bootcamps. I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React/Redux, and also taught myself Electron. With these skills combined with the fundamentals I learned by first coding in C++ at UCLA, I really feel like I'm ready to enter the industry as a software engineer. I'm thrilled to meet my next opportunity right around the corner.

          <h5>DJ</h5>
          <p>
            Music is a huge part of my life and always has been. I began DJing out of curiousity when I had just entered high school. I convinced my dad to let me borrow a few hundred dollars to get some cheap equipment and after about a year of asking around (yes it was as sad as it sounds), I was finally offered my first gig, a small-time sweet 16 party for a close friend. Upon making money, I immediately paid my dad back and since, have built a respectable name for myself in the South Asian communities in both Northern and Southern California. Although I work solo, I have provided complete audio-visual entertainment at several events including weddings, birthdays, graduations, and more. A goal of mine down the road is to learn more music theory, pick up a few instruments, and eventually produce my own music. Check out some of my music

          </p>
          <h5>Dance</h5>
          <p>
            Dance was undoubtedly the second largest consumer of my time throughout college, the first being studying of course. In high school, I was captain of a dance team performing a traditional and energetic Indian dance called bhangra. Upon entering UCLA, I knew I wanted to join it's competitive bollywood team, Nashaa, which I was a fan of throughout high school. I was selected my freshman year and eventually climbed the ladder to be elected captain for my junior year. We went on to win the national championship that year, which was one of the biggest highlights of my college career; check out the performance
            <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxrfJm4EK0I'>video</a>! I had been making the audio mix for my team ever since joining, but this year was the first that received the award for best mix, which was a tremendous personal achievement in my book. In addition to dancing, my team also hosted a competition on our own turf every year. By bringing together more than 200 contestants and an audience of several thousands, we accumulated a total revenue of over $35,000, most of which we donated to several charities.
          </p>
          <h5>Fitness</h5>
          <p>
            I was severly overweight entering the 7th grade. I eventually realized that no growth spurt nor a miracle is going to change my life. My life was in my OWN hands. After a few years of paying more attention to my diet, I was able to attain a healthy bodyweight; however, by the time I was leaving high school, I had become a fitness junkie. I was addicted, but for the better. Having lost several family members to cardiovascular diseases, I made a promise to myself that no matter what life throws at me, I will always prioritize health. I have stayed true to this promise so far and I am confident that I always will. I am a strong supporter of prevention over treatment and hope to one day help others, beyond just family and friends, to lead and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
